It's Tetromino Problem using Brute-Force Algorithm.

https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/14500

Problem:
A polyomino is a figure with several 1 × 1 squares, and the following conditions must be met.
- The squares should not overlap each other
- All figures must be connecter
- The sides of the square should be connected. That is, it should not touch only the corner and the vertex.

Polymino with four squares, is called Tetromino.
Pictures of 5 tetrominos are in the link.

I want to put one Tetromino on paper of size N × M. The paper is divided into 1 × 1 size cells, each of which contains an integer.

Write a program that maximizes the sum of the numbers written in the space where the tetromino is placed by placing one tetromino.

The tetromino must be placed so that one square contains exactly one square, and may be rotated or symmetrically placed.

Input:
In the first line, the vertical size N of the paper and the horizontal size M are given.(4<=N, M<=500)

From the second line, N lines give the number written on the paper. The jth number in the i-th row is the number from the top to the ith column, from the left to the j-th column. The number given as input is a natural number not exceeding 1,000.

Output:
In the first line, the maximum value of the sum of the numbers written in the column where Tetromino is placed.

Examples of Input and Output is in that link.
